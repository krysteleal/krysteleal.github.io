			<p>The work I did on Sílvia Xará's website was gratifying. I worked with Sílvia in the creation of her new website, as well as in the production of her brand image. It was total teamwork. I received her ideas and materialized them into a complete branding, which is deconstructed in the different icons and representations of Sílvia's work.
				<br>	
				<br>The website was developed not only to present the services but also prepared for the selling and distribution of digital products. I worked not only in the construction of the website (WordPress) but also in the implementation of the selling integration, using Woocmmerce, where Silvia can sell her meditations. I also created her branding (logo, iconography, and branding).
