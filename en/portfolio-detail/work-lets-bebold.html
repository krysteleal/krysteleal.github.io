			<p>I met Susi Helen, founder of BeBold, in California, and we immediately had an excellent connection. We started to work with a customer relationship: she hired me to improve the first BeBold website.
				<br>	
				<br>The years passed, and I ended up being responsible for the digital repositioning of BeBold, and I joined the team as a Business Strategist. It is constant learning to work with Susi. Thank you for your trust!
