			<p>Made by Choices is one of the most successful food projects in Portugal, and everything is due to the work and the person that Vânia Ribeiro is.
				<br>	
				<br>Vânia is inspiring and she is attentive to details and with a very personal way of working.
				<br>I worked in the creation of her Media Kit, a document that serves as a presentation and pitch to potential partners and brands.
