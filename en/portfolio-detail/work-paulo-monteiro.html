			<p>I worked with Paulo Monteiro, Professor at UC Berkeley, to optimize SEO On-Page for his website. The website had several problems that compromised its indexing, such as lack of meta tags, console errors and invalid scripts.
				<br>	
				<br>All of this was fixed. I also searched for the main keywords of the niche, and I took the opportunity to optimize some of the content of the website.
