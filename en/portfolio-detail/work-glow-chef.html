			<p>I worked with Sílvia Taveira from the start of her Glow Chef project. An easy-to-navigate blog was created that represents the essence and freshness of the Glow Chef brand.
				<br>	
				<br>I worked on the logo, website creation, and also on the design and layout of various ebooks and materials by Glow Chef, on the digital communication of events, on the production and design of newsletters, and the development of internal documents like the Media Kit.
