			<p>I worked with Bernardo on the design of the free eBook that he has available on his website. After this successful work, Bernardo contacted me again to work on the general layout of his Wix website.
				<br>	
				<br>I ended up developing the Acontece no Vale website! It is a pleasure to be behind the site that is a useful guide about California written in Portuguese.

			<p><span>Reference:</span> "Working with Krystel was a really good experience. She took care of the marketing and some visual aspects of my website, and I'm very happy with the result. When something couldn't be the way I wanted it, she always gave me the best alternatives and was always available to give her perspective, which was really helpful. Overall, she was very professional and a pleasure to work with. I highly recommend it."</p>
