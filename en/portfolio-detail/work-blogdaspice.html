			<p>Working with Sofia, the founder of the Blog da Spice, was super cool. She already knew exactly what she wanted, but even with her ideas, she was always open to listen to my suggestions. It was teamwork!
				<br>
				<br>The work developed on Blog da Spice included the creation of the website, but also the personalized creation of recipe pages, individual recipe modules for easy reading and printing, and integration of online payments for services such as workshops, events, and home cooking services.
