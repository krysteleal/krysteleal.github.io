			<p>The Nomadismo Digital Portugal is a website about remote work, freelance, and digital entrepreneurship. Created by me when I became a full-time freelancer, it is today a reference in this segment. I create multiple formats of contents such as articles, videos, ebooks, courses, workshops, webinars, and others.
				<br>	
				<br>The whole project was created by me, from the strategy, branding, website, material design, and all the contents that are signed by me or by Nomadismo Digital Portugal are my own.
