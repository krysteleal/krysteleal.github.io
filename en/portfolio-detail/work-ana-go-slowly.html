			<p>If I had to make a list of people that inspires me today, Ana Milhazes would undoubtedly be on that list. Founder of Zero Waste Portugal, Ana has one of the blogs that I have been following for the longest time, and that changed my life: her Ana, Go Slowly.
				<br>	
				<br>How could I refuse her invitation to work on her new branding and website? The website represents Ana's values and aims to be a guide for beginners and curious people of various themes that help us to create more conscious life.
