			<p>When Cláudia Soeiro contacted me, we had an immediate connection. Two Portuguese women who live abroad, but with a desire to continue adding value to our country. The GCREW is a project for women who feel more than ever the need to sit down, with a hot drink or a glass of wine, and share, speak, learn from other women, and feel the mind expand with sharing—an old fashioned social club, but adapted to the modern woman.
				<br>
				<br>The work developed with GCREW included creating the website, optimizing the content, and organizing all ideas in a way that made sense to the target client of the project.
