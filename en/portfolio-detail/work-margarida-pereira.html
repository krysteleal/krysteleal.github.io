			<p>It is already the second website I do with Margarida. I made the last website that Margarida had and this second version. Working with Margarida is not only easy but rewarding. She has so much knowledge, maturity, and generosity.
				<br>	
				<br>I work with Margarida like a real team. The website that I create for her was designed pixel by pixel, following the bright idea that Margarida had for her "digital home." It is a website that represents her and her professional knowledge.
