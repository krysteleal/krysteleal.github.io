			<p>It is always a pleasure to work with Sofia de Assunção. This work was the creation of a landing page for her online Academy. The page was completely personalized and made according to a draft thought by her.
				<br>	
				<br>The landing page was made in WordPress to allow future updates and modifications and has custom popups and external links for payments.
