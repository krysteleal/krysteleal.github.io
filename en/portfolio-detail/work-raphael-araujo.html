			<p>Create a professionally presented website is always challenging. A "portfolio" must respect the values, positioning, and professionalism of the person. And when that person is a Surgeon and Doctor, the challenge is even more significant!
				<br>	
				<br>Create the website of Dr. Raphael Araujo, a Brazilian Oncology Surgeon, was a challenge and a great learning experience. The site was developed entirely in WordPress and integrated the presentation of the curriculum, medical publications dynamically, and all relevant information of Dr. Raphael Araujo.
