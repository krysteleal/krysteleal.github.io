			<p>I'm super happy with this work. Mil Grãos is a project full of positive and well-defined values. Mil Grãos is not just a website but an authentic home: where people feel good, where the content is easily found and where Dulce can present, in an authentic way, the work she does.

				<br>Customer Feedback: "In addition to content full of value for all those who want to work online, Krystel has the gift of making what looks complicated into something easy to understand. You can't imagine how happy I am with this new home from Mil Grãos. See how everything is so beautiful!"
