			<p>Working with Leila Monteiro on the Sabiina Design Atelier website was one of my best professional experiences. For this project, I needed to understand the brand's feelings and define the goals that needed to be achieved with this digital presence. The result was a modern website, aligned with the elegant design of the pieces developed by the Sabiina Design Atelier and a multilingual website to reach the national and international audience.
				<br>
				The work involved creating a 100% responsive, multilingual, and SEO-optimized website.
