			<p>Vikāsa means, in Sara's words, "growth, evolution, serenity, and joy." These were the fundamental values ​​for creating the website and the logo. Sara had an idea for what she wanted from her website and her logo, but she accepted all the suggestions I was giving her, making this work an authentic team effort.
