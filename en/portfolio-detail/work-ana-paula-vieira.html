			<p>Ana's work involves mourning, overcoming, and looking for light. Her website needed to reflect that. With face-to-face and online services, we had to create an easy way so that the contact-making was intuitive for anyone who enters the site.
				<br>	
				<br>With light colors that reflect the light and brightness, Ana's website is informative but also inspiring with content published on her blog space.
